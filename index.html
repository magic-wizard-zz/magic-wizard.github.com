		<h1>Hey there, JVST</h1>

		<h2 class="intro">I'm Garrett, and <a href="#you">I think you're awesome</a>. Let's work together.</h2>

		<h3>First, a little bit about me</h3>
		
		<blockquote>A designer knows he has achieved perfection not when there is nothing left to add, but when there is nothing left to take away.<footer>—Antoine De Saint-Exupery</footer></blockquote>	

		<p><span class="highlight">I’m a designer</span> who loves technology and I want to make it better. As an avid user advocate, and believe strongly that thoughtful design is the difference between an ok product and something brilliant. You've (hopefully) seen my resume so I won't bore you with buzzwords and a skill list, but it's worth emphasizing that, after 5 years of professional design experience, I feel very proficient in HTML, CSS, and Adobe products, and I can even write a little JavaScript. Simplicity, elegance, getting out the of way. These are the core ideas behind most great design, and they're what I focus on in my work.</p>

		<p>Right now I work for a company called mFoundry. We make apps for financial institutions, and I make extensions and improvements to mobile, tablet, and web apps on the product team. I love the people I work with, and the things we're doing are challenging, but I'm always looking for something new and interesting to dive into. I think you might be just that! </p>

		<p>I put together a few screenshots below of some things I've recently worked on that I think might be up your alley, and haven't yet made it to <a href="http://www.garrettfarmer.com">my portfolio</a>.</p>

		<p class="fancy-wrap">

			<a class="fancybox" href="images/1_b.jpg" data-fancybox-group="gallery" title="Send money to your friends!"><img src="images/1_s.jpg" alt="" /></a>

			<a class="fancybox" href="images/2_b.jpg" data-fancybox-group="gallery" title="Never type your credit card number again."><img src="images/2_s.jpg" alt="" /></a>

			<a class="fancybox" href="images/4_b.jpg" data-fancybox-group="gallery" title="Middle managers in banking spend a lot of time approving things."><img src="images/4_s.jpg" alt="" /></a>
		</p>

		<p><span class="highlight">"But what do you do when you aren't designing, Garrett?"</span> Good question! I'm interested in about a billion things outside of work. I consider myself a lifelong learner, and enjoy reading about current events/politics, fiction, and just about anything design related. I also like PC games, wandering the bay area, burritos, IPAs, drawing, and Netflix. Hopefully I'll soon fulfill my lifelong dream of getting a dog as well. There are so many things I want to know more about, and not nearly enough time!</p>
		
		<h3 id="you">OK, now let's talk about you</h3>

		<blockquote> We run a tight ship of miscreants and corporate robots, and fun is outlawed.<footer>—You</footer></blockquote>

		<p><span class="highlight">You guys are JVST, and you're a bunch of badasses</span> that come together in the form of a second to none full service design agency. You don't just think about how things should be done - you think about why things should be done. You are forward-thinking, ambitious, and thoughtful. You also really love dogs, and have a nice responsive website.</p>

		<p><span class="highlight">You might even decide</span> that you need an extra breakpoint for a given design and record that in sketch form; you can add that breakpoint to your graph. This is a cycle of discovery, learning, and revision.</p>
