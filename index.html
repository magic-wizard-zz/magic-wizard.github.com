		<h1>Hello mFoundry!</h1>
		<h2>I hope we can be friends. Why don’t you take a minute to read about me and some of the things I like <a href="#you">about you</a>.</h2>
		
		<img class="avatar" src="images/me-thumb.png"><h3>A little bit about me</h3>
		<p><span class="highlight">I love the technology</span> (especially the internet), and I want to make it better. I believe strongly that good design is the difference between an ok product and something brilliant. And I'm certain that design isn't just about typography, white space, and pretty pixels. Although those pieces of visual design are vital, the best designers advocate broadly for users.</p>

		<p><span class="highlight">You might even decide</span> that you need an extra breakpoint for a given design and record that in sketch form; you can add that breakpoint to your graph. This is a cycle of discovery, learning, and revision.</p>

		<blockquote> To design is much more than simply to assemble, to order, or even to edit; it is to dignify, to dramatize, to persuade, and perhaps even to amuse.<footer>- Jean-luc Picard</footer></blockquote>
