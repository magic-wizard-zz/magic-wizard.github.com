		<h1>Hey there, Bigole Name</h1>

		<h2 class="intro">I'm Garrett and I make stuff. I think <a href="#you">you</a> and I would really get along.</h2>

		<h3>Get to know me</h3>
		<p><span class="highlight">I’m a graphic designer</span> who loves the web, design, beauty and things that are enjoyable to use. I am as excited by smart mark-up and clever css as I am by the single pixel that makes that button perfect. I think that “Designed by Apple in California” is the most brilliant thing to ever appear on a package.</p>

		<blockquote>A designer knows he has achieved perfection not when there is nothing left to add, but when there is nothing left to take away.<footer>—Antoine De Saint-Exupery</footer></blockquote>		

		<p>I have been called a “serial hobbyist.” There is so much to be interested in, to learn about, and to pour one’s creativity into. I spend time with our dogs, aquariums, Lego, computers, video games, drawing, ceramics, NFL Football (Go Packers!), photography, and traveling. There are a million things I want to try, to do, to be better at. There is never enough time in the day, week, or year for everything; though I’m really trying.</p>

		<p> work for an awesome company in Oklahoma City called Element Fusion. We make some pretty great products, too. We have an amazing team of designers, we use and admire 37signals’ products, and we try our best to make customers happy. I’m the creative director here which sounds fancy but really means that I help our designers be their best and ensure that the work they do is awesome. I am also in charge of making our web apps beautiful and fun to use. I think we do a pretty good job, our customers seem to think so, too.</p>

		<p>Element Fusion is a great place to work. I have creative freedom, a good work environment, talented co-workers and am handsomely compensated. Really, I cannot think of anything that would keep me from being here a very long time. But I always want more. Not necessarily stuff or money, but I want to learn more and get better. I want to keep the pressure up. I want to take on the toughest challenges.</p>
		
		<h3 id="you">OK, now let's talk about you</h3>
		<p><span class="highlight">I love the technology</span> (especially the internet), and I want to make it better. I believe strongly that good design is the difference between an ok product and something brilliant. And I'm certain that design isn't just about typography, white space, and pretty pixels. Although those pieces of visual design are vital, the best designers advocate broadly for users.</p>

		<p><span class="highlight">You might even decide</span> that you need an extra breakpoint for a given design and record that in sketch form; you can add that breakpoint to your graph. This is a cycle of discovery, learning, and revision.</p>
