		<h1>Hey there, Bigole Name</h1>

		<h2 class="intro">I'm Garrett, and <a href="#you">I think you're awesome</a>. Let's work together.</h2>

		<h3>First, a little bit about me</h3>
		
		<blockquote>A designer knows he has achieved perfection not when there is nothing left to add, but when there is nothing left to take away.<footer>—Antoine De Saint-Exupery</footer></blockquote>	

		<p><span class="highlight">I’m a designer</span> who loves technology and I want to make it better. I'm an avid user advocate, and believe strongly that good design is the difference between an ok product and something brilliant. Simplicity, elegance, getting out the of way. These are the core ideas behind most great design, and they're often what I focus on in my work.</p>

		<p>Right now I work for a company called mFoundry. We primarily help financial institutions make their services and content accessible to their more tech savvy users, and I make extensions and improvements to mobile, tablet, and web apps on the product team. I'm happy with the people I work with and the things we're doing are challenging, but I'm always looking for new and more interesting opportunities. I think you might be just that!</p>

		<p>I put together a few screenshots below of some things I've recently worked on that I think might be up your alley, and haven't yet made it to <a href="http://www.garrettfarmer.com">my portfolio</a>.</p>

		<p><span class="highlight">When I'm not at work</span> lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged.</p>
		
		<h3 id="you">OK, now let's talk about you</h3>
		<p><span class="highlight">You guys are CompanyName</span> and you're awesome.It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>

		<blockquote> To design is much more than simply to assemble, to order, or even to edit; it is to dignify, to dramatize, to persuade, and perhaps even to amuse.<footer>- Jean-luc Picard</footer></blockquote>

		<p><span class="highlight">You might even decide</span> that you need an extra breakpoint for a given design and record that in sketch form; you can add that breakpoint to your graph. This is a cycle of discovery, learning, and revision.</p>
